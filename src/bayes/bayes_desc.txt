1. Work well for:

 * text classification:
 - article category classification,
 - sentiment analisis

 * in robotics,

 * image classification(poker hands images),

 * problemy segmentacji

2. Is more efficient than other techniques of machine learning

 * can work for smaller amount of data,

 * adapts more quickly for new data items,

 * after a new item comes in we do not have to change all structure,

 * we can concurrently compute data probs(e.x for each class),

 * we can select couple of data categories(features) and compute model correctness

3. However, they are 'naive' - i.e. they assume the features are independent

4. How do we can improve an algorithm:

 * remove highly correlated features items, because this items can make some feature stronger,

 * compare features using correlation matrix,
